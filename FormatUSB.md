## FIRST THING FIRST

This is a quick personal reference for creating a bootable Kali USB Drive (Kali Live) with Persistence. For a few years I've wanted to have a live Kali that I can take with me anywhere and be able to boot anywhere. New year, fresh new release (without root as the main user), so this is it.

This guide is mainly based (mostly just copy pasted actually) on Kali's documentation that can be found [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/usb/kali-linux-live-usb-install/).

### What You’ll Need

1. A *verified* copy of the appropriate ISO image of the latest Kali build image for the system you’ll be running it on: see the details on [downloading official Kali Linux images](https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images/).
